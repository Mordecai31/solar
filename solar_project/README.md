# Solar Recommender and Watts Calculator System

This project is a comprehensive system for recommending solar panel installations and calculating power requirements. It takes into account user budget, appliance usage, and geographical location to provide optimized solar solutions.

## Features

*   **Appliance-based Load Calculation:** Calculates total energy consumption based on user's appliances and usage patterns.
*   **Location-aware Irradiance Analysis:** Uses weather data (historical or real-time API) to determine solar irradiance for the user's location.
*   **Component Sizing:** Recommends the optimal number of solar panels, battery capacity, inverter size, and charge controller specifications.
*   **Budget Optimization:** Finds the best component combination within the user's budget.
*   **ML-powered Recommendations:** (Future) Will use machine learning to provide even smarter recommendations based on historical data.
*   **System Simulation:** Simulates the performance of the recommended system.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Generates a comprehensive report of the recommended solar setup.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

*   `agents/`: Contains the intelligent agents responsible for different tasks in the workflow.
*   `core/`: Holds the core business logic, calculations, and constants.
*   `data/`: Stores raw, processed, and sample data.
*   `models/`: Contains machine learning models and related code.
*   `services/`: Includes the API, database operations, and other services.
*   `web/`: The frontend web application.
*   `tests/`: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   `config/`: Configuration files for different environments.
*   ... and more.
